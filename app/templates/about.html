    <h3>Welcome to the About page. Here you can find information about me.</h3>
    <p>Hello! I'm Ahsan Baseer, a passionate and ambitious Computer Science student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science at Brooklyn College, with an expected graduation in May 2025. With a strong academic background and a GPA of 3.8, I have consistently been on the Dean's List.
        I have honed my skills through various internships. Currently, I am an incoming Software Engineer Intern at Verizon, where I will be collaborating with the Customer Experience team to enhance software solutions. I also love learning about Production Engineering!
